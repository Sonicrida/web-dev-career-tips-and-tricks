# Web Development Career Tips and Tricks

A bunch of useful thoughts and links that I have decided to put together after being helped and helping a lot of others in the [Reactiflux jobs-advice discord channel](https://discord.gg/BDXNJqD). There are a lot of questions that had me typing similar responses over and over so I've decided to make a repo to make that information more easily available.

Expect this to be a combination of my thoughts on various topics as well as useful links to articles and other resources that may help you in your career. I'll keep this updated as much as I reasonably can and/or when I see some really golden advice. Feel free to add things that you think are useful as long as they are in line with my goal of this being easily digestable and not a massive link dump.

I have a ton of things to add but I'll be starting off with some links for those that are looking for jobs!

If you have any questions, feel free to **[reach out to me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Sonicrida)**!

## Job Hunting

### Places To Find Jobs

There are tons of places but a lot of them are a mess to sift through. Here are some of my favorites but these definitely aren't the only places that you can find work

* [AngelList Startup Jobs](https://angel.co/jobs)
* [Stackoverflow Careers](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs)
* [Github Jobs](https://jobs.github.com/positions)
* [The Hacker News Monthly "Who's Hiring" Posts](https://hn.algolia.com/?sort=byDate&prefix=false&page=0&dateRange=all&type=story&storyText=false&query=Ask%20HN:%20Who%20is%20Hiring%3F%202018)  
  This will list the posts from 2018 but I'm sure that there is a lot of value in modifying the query to view the 2017 posts as well. [HN Hiring](http://hnhiring.me/) is a site dedicated to searching through these posts but keep in mind that you need to click through to see comments because there can be useful information in them. There is also a monthly post for [Freelancers](https://hn.algolia.com/?sort=byDate&prefix=false&page=0&dateRange=all&type=story&storyText=false&query=Ask%20HN:%20freelancer%3F%20seeking) as well as a [Who wants to be Hired?](https://hn.algolia.com/?sort=byDate&prefix=false&page=0&dateRange=all&type=story&storyText=false&query=Ask%20HN:%20Who%20wants%20to%20be%20hired) post for people willing to post their info and be contacted directly instead.
* [Regional Tech Slacks](https://github.com/ladyleet/tech-community-slacks)  
  Many cities or regions have a dedicated tech slack group and they usually have a jobs channel for people looking for work in those locations. This is a nice list of them put together by [Tracy Lee](https://github.com/ladyleet)
* **Companies you like**  
  Most companies have some sort of "jobs" or "careers" page. Think about companies that are using technologies that you enjoy or have a product that you like and maybe even use. Not every job gets posted to the major job boards
* [The Reactiflux Jobs Channel](http://jobs.reactiflux.com/)  
  A lot of cool jobs (many of these are react focused) are posted in the #jobs channel in the Reactiflux Discord. You can [join here](https://www.reactiflux.com/) if you'd like to view the channel directly or interact with the largest developer chat room/community that I'm aware of on the internet.

**Keep in mind that networking will always be better than any of the things listed above. I'll write about that soon but keep in mind that you're up against the world when you're only focused on cold approaching companies with job applications.** 

### Here's a short list of things to look into until I write a proper section on networking
* Conferences
* Meetups
* Reaching out and interacting with the tech community. I recommend starting with Twitter. Many devs of the tools you use have Twitter accounts that are easy to discover.
* Content Creation - blogging and tutorials(medium or host your own), youtube videos, podcasts, cast studies, ect.
* Open Source Contributions
